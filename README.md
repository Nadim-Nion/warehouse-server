# BooksHive (Server Side)

## Warehouse or Inventory Management Website


### Description:
BooksHive is a MERN stack project focusing on managing an inventory of books. This repository contains the server-side implementation of the project, handling backend functionalities such as database interactions, authentication, and API endpoints.

### Key Features & Functionalities:
- **MongoDB Integration**: Utilizes MongoDB to store inventory data, user information, and newly added books.
- **User Authentication**: Implements email/password-based authentication along with social login (Google, Facebook) using JWT tokens.
- **Protected Routes**: Utilizes JWT tokens to protect private routes like inventory details and manage items.
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations for managing inventory items, including updating quantity, deleting items, and adding new items.
- **Detailed Item Views**: Provides detailed views of inventory items with options to update quantity and view supplier information.
- **Pagination for Books**: API endpoints support pagination to retrieve books in batches.
- **Email Verification**: Basic implementation of email verification (email may go to spam folder).
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors for incorrect login credentials and utilizes meaningful error messages throughout the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Blog Section**: Includes a non-protected route for answering questions related to JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL vs NoSQL, and JWT.
- **Meaningful 404 Page**: Implements a custom 404 page for handling page-not-found scenarios.

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /books/all`: Retrieves all books with pagination support.
- `GET /booksCount`: Gets the total count of books in the collection.
- `GET /books/first-six`: Retrieves the first six books.
- `GET /books/:id`: Retrieves a specific book by its ID.
- `POST /books/:id/delivered`: Decreases the quantity of a book after delivery.
- `POST /books/:id/restock`: Increases the quantity of a book after restocking.
- `DELETE /books/:id`: Deletes a book from the inventory.
- `GET /newAddedBooks`: Retrieves newly added books by user email.
- `POST /newAddedBooks`: Adds a new book to the user's collection.
- `GET /newAddedBooks/:id`: Retrieves a specific newly added book by ID.
- `DELETE /newAddedBooks/:id`: Deletes a newly added book from the user's collection.

### Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Token-based authentication mechanism.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to backend API.
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables.

### Additional Notes:
- Organized and clean code structure.
- Environment variables used for sensitive information.
- Implements JWT token-based authentication for user sessions.
- Ensures data integrity and security with MongoDB integration.

   ```Absolutely, here's the section on commits with a potential improvement:

## Commits

This repository adheres to a structured commit message convention to enhance readability and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key commit types:

- **feat:** Introduces a new feature to the application.
- **fix:** Addresses a bug or issue identified in the codebase.
- **docs:** Encompasses changes made to documentation, such as updates, additions, or corrections.
- **style:** Covers formatting adjustments, whitespace changes, or fixing minor inconsistencies like missing semicolons.
- **refactor:** Represents code structure improvements without altering functionality. This can involve code organization, renaming variables or functions, or improving readability.
- **test:** Introduces new tests or updates existing tests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **chore:** Encompasses changes that don't directly affect the application's functionality, such as updating build tasks, package manager configurations, or dependency versions.

**Optional Improvement:**

Consider adopting a more comprehensive commit message convention like Conventional Commits ([https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)). This approach provides a standard format for commit messages, including type, scope (optional), and a clear description of the change, making it easier to generate changelogs, automate workflows, and collaborate effectively.

By following these guidelines and potentially adopting a more detailed convention, you'll ensure clear and consistent commit messages that benefit you and your team in the long run.
